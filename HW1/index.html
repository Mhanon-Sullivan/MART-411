        <h2>Nonni Sullivan</h2>
        <h4>MART 411 - Web Technologies</h4>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Nonni. I'm a third-year Media Arts major with a strong focus in animation! I'll earn my Bachelor's degree in Spring 2026, and then I'll move on to graduate studies in Media Arts the following semester. I mainly work frame-by-frame in form, but I'm also a huge fan of basic illustration. One of the most important things you should know about me is that I'm utterly obsessed with color. I LOVE it! I make sure every aspect of my life is as colorful as I can make it. From my wardrobe to my artwork to my belongings, I try to be as bright as I can be. You'll often see me on campus in my orange coat with my rainbow tie-dye backpack! Feel free to say hi!</p>
        <p>I take a lot of inspiration from cartoons I grew up with, as well as from indie projects that are revolutionizing the world of modern animation. Some of my biggest inspirations are My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, Steven Universe, Hazbin Hotel, and Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja.</p>

        <h2>Video Game Memory</h2>
        <p>When I was four, my dad and I would play Ratchet and Clank on our PS2. Most of the time, he would play and occasionally pass me the controller, guiding me through the story and controls. Eventually, he let me loose on the first level with no help. After multiple playthroughs and many in-game deaths (mainly due to the distance between the buttons; it's a big controller for such little hands!), I was given one final chance before dinner.</p>

        <p>I battled my way through enemies and platforming, and completed the whole thing without dying a single time. I was absolutely elated when I beat it. I remember looking at up at my dad - I can only describe the look on his face as sheer pride, with the biggest smile I've ever seen on his face. It's a huge accomplishment for a four year old. I was his only daughter, as well, so I think this kind of connection between us was important to him. I think was important for me, too.</p>
