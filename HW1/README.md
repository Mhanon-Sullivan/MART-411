This week I wanted to show you my basic (very basic, as it stands) skills in web design, as a basis for the rest of the semester. I always have a lot of fun with color design in my projects, and this one is no different. If you couldn't tell already, I really like orange. I also really like deer.
I took the prerequisite web design course last semester, so the skills I learned are still pretty fresh in my mind, thankfully. To give you some context for the illustrations, they're either assets for my YouTube channel, or concept pieces for my upcoming animated short film, featuring the blonde girl you see featured. Her name is Hennley and she's a shepherd to a flock of itty bitty sheep. If you're ever interested in seeing the rough animatic for the project, let me know! I'd be happy to send it your way.
Overall, I didn't come across and glaring issues. I had to replace a few of the images for the shows I picked, but that was just a resolution issue. I can't wait to learn more throughout the rest of the semester, and I'm so happy to be working with you again!
