Hi!
This week's homework was easy and fun. After finishing the portion I made myself, I hopped on over to ChatGPT and asked it to do the homework as well. I was shocked to see how similar it was to mine:

// interactive_script.js

// Displaying favorite websites in the console
console.log("Favorite Websites:");
console.log("1. https://www.github.com");
console.log("2. https://www.stackoverflow.com");
console.log("3. https://www.medium.com");

// Displaying favorite games in the console
console.log("Favorite Games:");
console.log("1. Monopoly");
console.log("2. Among Us");
console.log("3. Minecraft");

// Displaying favorite artists and their contributions
console.log("Favorite Artists:");
console.log("1. Pablo Picasso - Pioneer of Cubism and modern art.");
console.log("2. Maya Angelou - Celebrated poet and civil rights activist.");
console.log("3. Leonardo da Vinci - Master of Renaissance art and innovation.");

// Interactive prompt for the user
const dreamDestination = prompt("If you could visit any place in the world, where would you go?");
console.log(`Dream destination: ${dreamDestination}`);


While I do feel as though I could accurately explain everything it did, I could not claim this work as my own. Despite it being quite similar to my own work, the goal was to work out the problems on my own in the name of learning. Had I simply printed this out and turned it in, I would not have figured out how to implement the prompt feature as properly as I did, and in-turn, would not know how to do so in the future. The AI code is also impersonal. I try to personalize my projects as much as I'm allowed to, so turning this in as my own would feel wrong to me.
